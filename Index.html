<h1>Ok Here I go</h1>
<p>It was a hard time for me these last years. If you read this I maybe be still alive or already gone. Experienced abuse and other things got multiple problems from getting arrested to developing disorders. Getting arrested and being put in a mental asylum and living in a forest for a month I'm just gonna go and get a new life. Please don't cry cause I don't know you except you're just a stranger online I already heard from multiple people not do but I already did it as I said to them you can't change a mind that's already locked to something I always cared for myself self Care isn't being selfish and attempting suicide is just being brave in a dark way I'm just gonna stop typing cause no one will care about 

My last words I said online 
"You can't change a mind that's already locked to something"</p>
